  <h4 style="text-align:center">Writer: <u>Muhammad Tarek</u></h4>
  <p>This novel begins with a strange dedication:
    To the drug dealer whom I mocked five years ago when he swore that the drug trade is <em><strong>truer</strong></em> than the trade in love and the body and <em><strong>less harmful</strong></em> than the trade in religious and political words and words of love.<br>
    I dedicate this novel to you and apologize for my ignorance and sarcasm at the time...<br>
    From here, we will realize that it is a story of betrayal and many setbacks.. <em><strong>Different</strong></em> characters are brought together by feelings that do not stand against the wind, so pride wakes up, <em><strong>heavy</strong></em>, but <em><strong>unbridled</strong></em>, and <em><strong>not defeated</strong></em> by the passage of time..<br>
    Between these lines, nostalgia will take us. We may <em><strong>weaken and yearn</strong></em>, and we will start writing <em><strong>long</strong></em> letters mixed with sighs. We will forgive as if our hearts had never been hurt by the bitterness of pain... But in the end we will not fall and we will wear the mask of <em><strong>strength</strong></em> again to wake up the urgent question in the soul... For how long?!</p>
